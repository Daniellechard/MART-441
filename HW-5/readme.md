This homework seemed like it would be easier since I've already dealt with arrays before but for some reason my photos wouldn't show up in the browser. I know I must be doing something wrong but I can't figure out what? I even tried renaming the photos to see if they would show up then but no luck there. Hopefully it is an easy fix and I'll be able to move onto week 6's homework before I fall behind. It was a lot less code than last week so I'm disappointed that I'm still not able to find the issue. Never mind, I just remembered the console and it told me exactly what was wrong so it's all fixed now. I feel like and idiot haha.
