I'm not sure what we were supposed to do with the html file in this week's folder and I couldn't get the css to link to the html file so I just linked my js file to hw 1's html file and set the background color in there as well.

This week was a little easier but I still feel like I'm not grasping some of the more basic principles and I've been having a lot of trouble just getting my css to show up.

However, the Code Academy tutorials were extremely helpful along with the code example on the "Code on This Site Page". The js stuff so far has been easier than getting my css stuff to work.
