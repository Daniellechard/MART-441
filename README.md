# MART-441 hw

This week was particularly frustrating due to the fact that I had
misinterpreted the initial homework assignment and thus was forced to rush
in order to catch up.

I seem to have pretty much completely forgotten most of the information learned
in Justine's web dev course since I haven't touch html or css since.

The trickiest part besides the obvious time crunch was the fact that my experience with adobe cc lead me to make the silly mistake of putting the body font in pt instead of px format which made it impossible for the web page to resize responsively.

I spent a lot more time on this assignment than I had anticipated due mostly to a simple syntax error which was incredibly frustrating but a good lesson to remember.
