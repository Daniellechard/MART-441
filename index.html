<h1>Danielle Davis</h1>
<h3>Brand designer, Graphic artist, and Content creator</h3>




<h6>
<p>
  I am a graphic designer based in Missoula, MT
  who likes to work with businesses in order to
  create and maintain an aesthetic feel that is
  all their own in order to boost sales, increase
  brand recognition, and leave a positive lasting
  impression on their customers and clients.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a senior in the University of Montanaâ€™s
  media arts program, majoring in Digital Arts and Technology.
  When I graduate in this summer, I will be graduating with
  my Sales and Marketing certificate from the Missoula college
  in addition to my BFA in Digital Arts. I currently work
  with the University of Montana Foundation as their in-house
  graphic designer creating digital and print assets ranging
  from social media graphics to annual giving reports
</p>

<p>
  I view the design process as a collaborative one
  and believe that the best work is produced when
  the designer and the client work together in order
  to achieve the ideal possible outcome, where neither
  party feels unheard.
