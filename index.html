<h3>Brand designer, Graphic artist, and Content creator</h3>




<h6>
<p>
  I am a graphic designer based in Missoula, MT
  who likes to work with businesses in order to
  create and maintain an aesthetic feel that is
  all their own in order to boost sales, increase
  brand recognition, and leave a positive lasting
  impression on their customers and clients.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a senior in the University of Montanaâ€™s
media arts program, majoring in Digital Arts and Technology.
When I graduate in this summer, I will be graduating with
my Sales and Marketing certificate from the Missoula college
in addition to my BFA in Digital Arts. I currently work
with the University of Montana Foundation as their in-house
graphic designer creating digital and print assets ranging
from social media graphics to annual giving reports
