This week went pretty well but no matter what I tried I just couldn't get an image to show up at first on the webpage. You have to click the button at least once for anything to show up.
It was fun learning more about Van Gogh's paintings thought. As much as I've admired his artwork over the years I've never actually sat down to read about their history. Overall, everything else works the way it's supposed to and I even color coordinated the text and background to match the photos.
