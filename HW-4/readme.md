Things started clicking a little bit more with the whole 'DOM' thing this weekend and how updating things works and how it can be really useful. I still feel like I have a long way to go until I'm comfortable with it or feel proficient enough in it to build a well made, modern website but I think I might be by the time the class is over if things keep clicking into place.
