I couldn't get the collision function to work and therefore could not complete the parts of the assignment relating to that such as the objects and background changing when the objects collide. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to start on this homework when I should have because I was still working on the homework from the week before so hopefully next week I'll be able to finish all the requirements since I won't be behind. I was able to get the sound to work though which was pretty cool.
