This week wasn't too hard and most of the roadblocks I ran into I could solve myself either using the console or looking up solutions on the internet. I really enjoyed being able to use JQuery in order to fade things in and out. I had fun using my wedding photos to make a little slideshow for my husband since our 1 year anniversary is in a couple weeks. I'm excited to be able to use these principles and functions in more practical ways such as in website homepages to display products and such.
