I'm close to having a working game but there's still a few bugs to work out with the pages changing and the cards flipping back over. I even asked friends for help on this one and I think they might have just unintentionally confused me more. I look forward to starting the new project this next week since I can't seem to make this one work and it's getting a bit frustrating. I've also been having problems with atom so that's not helping either.
